PatternFly React charts are based on the
[Victory chart](https://formidable.com/open-source/victory/docs/victory-chart/)
library, along with additional functionality, custom components, and theming for
PatternFly.

PatternFly provides a collection of React-based components you can use to build
patterns with consistent markup, styling, and behavior.

PatternFly React charts are composed using separate components, so features are
more easily customizable. This course covers PatternFly bar chart - starting
with a simple chart, adding multiple datasets, tooltips, axis labels, a legend, 
and concluding by changing the theme color.
